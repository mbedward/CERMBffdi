# CERMBffdi

This is a small R package that provides functions to calculate Forest Fire
Danger Index (FFDI) from a set of input weather records. It has been developed
for use by the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, University
of Wollongong, Australia.

Feel free to use the package but please note that: (a) it comes with absolutely
no guarantee of reliability or correctness; and (b) functions are likely to
change in future versions. Bug reports and code contributions will be gratefully
accepted.

To install the package on your system run the following commands from your
favourite R console:

```
# Install the remotes package if not already present
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("mbedward/CERMBffdi")

```
